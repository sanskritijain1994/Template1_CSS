                <h3>What is Web Design</h3>
                <br>
            <p>Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. 
                It usually refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather 
                than software development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites 
                for desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet 
                browsers has become ever-increasingly important.

                A web designer works on the appearance, layout, and, in some cases, content of a 
                website. Appearance, for instance, relates to the colors, font, and images used. 
                Layout refers to how information is structured and categorized. A good web design is 
                easy to use, aesthetically pleasing, and suits the user group and brand of the website. 
                Many webpages are designed with a focus on simplicity, so that no extraneous information 
                and functionality that might distract or confuse users appears. As the keystone of a web 
                designer’s output is a site that wins and fosters the trust of the target audience, removing 
                as many potential points of user frustration as possible is a critical consideration.

                <b>Web designers</b> take your ideas and turn them into a mockup that shows what your future 
                website will look like. Web designers handle the creative part of designing a website.
                <br>
                <b>Web developers</b> —also sometimes called engineers or coders—take the mockup your web 
                designer made and translate it into a coding language so it can be displayed on the 
                web. They make websites functional, which often means custom-coding widgets and other 
                tools.
